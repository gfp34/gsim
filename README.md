# gsim
MIPS 2000 assembly program simulator.  

This program is designed to run MIPS 2000 assembly executable files generated by the R2K assembler 
[rasm](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~vcss345/documents/rasm.html) and R2K linker [rlink](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~vcss345/documents/rlink.html), and mimic the 
functionality of the R2K simulator [rsim](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~vcss345/documents/rsim.html). The R2K suite was developed by Prof. Warren R. Carithers
at RIT.
